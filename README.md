# Watcher Rebalance
This mod rebalances the Wtacher base game character to have less of a focus on burst damage.

**Current changes:**  
Wrath is only 50% inc damage dealt/taken
Calm, Gain 33% more Block.
Divinity, gain 3 energy and draw 2 cards on enter.
Gain 1 Mantra whenever you switch stances? (into or out of calm? between non-neutral stances? All switches?)
Divinity can be stacked, giving on enter benefits on turn start (or when switching into divinity from divinity, you gain a power that reads enter divinity at the start of your next x turns. This would get around the exit stance dilemma)

Remove vigor? and change Akabeko/Wreath of Fire
